EXAMPLE Preview v1 notes:
- 00:03–00:06: text feels too small; increase ~20%
- 00:07: transition is abrupt; add 0.3s ease
- 00:11: highlight the resistor BEFORE zoom
- 00:18: pacing too slow; cut this beat by ~2s
- Style: use thinner wire strokes like S01 throughout

Updates Notes:

(Generic) 
- Add Earth/Ground symbol to the bottom of R2 or the other floating node beneath Vin to show a complete circuit.
- V and R values are overlapping the graph, space them properly so no overlap
- I like the colours
- Add V (voltage) on y-axis of graph

(Timestamps)
0:10 - 0:20: Slow this down, add another 5 seconds to reduce pace.

0:20 - 0:30: Slow this down, add another 5 seconds to reduce pace. Additionally fade in a new Rl component in paralle with R2 on the schematic for better visualization. Ensure spacing is good and nothing overlaps.
